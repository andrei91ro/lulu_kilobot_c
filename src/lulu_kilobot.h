 * @brief Lulu P colony simulator extension that allows controlling a Kilobot robot by using a P colony based controller
 * In this header we declare the structure and functions of a basic Kilobot controller that is based on P colonies and implements a bidirectional symbolic object - numeric value conversion.
 * This application uses the Kilombo simulator and also the kilolib library for interfacing with both a simulated and real kilobot.

//   * RB_popfront() is to be called AFTER the data in RB_front() has been used
//   * head and tail indices are uint8_t, which can be updated atomically
//     - still, the updates need to be atomic, especially in RB_popfront()
